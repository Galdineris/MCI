# MCI

MCI is an simple gratitude journaling app.
It can be used to record and maintain a list of the little things in your day to day that make life a little more bearable.
It randomly selects 5 itens of your "list of things" when you open the app and can send you a notification everyday of something from your list.


Its purpose is to help you get up when you are feeling a little down.
A feeling, an object or even a person. If you like it, why not help future you not forget it?

Loosely inspired by the play "Every Brilliant Thing" written by Duncan Macmillan.
